    <p>My names is Callum Movric. My Student ID is S3793995 and my Student email is S3793995@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Tasmania and 
have lived there for most of my life. I am currently living in Victoria. I left year 12 early and now I am doing a IT and programming course so I can 
become degree admitted and start a bachelor in IT or Computer Science. I am currently working part time at officeworks. I used to spend all of my spare time
playing Counter-Strike Global Offensive but now I spend my time learning to skate, listening to music, and watching youtube.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">My Learning Style and Personality Type</h2>
    <hr style="width:978px" class="w3-opacity">
<p>After taking the Educationplanner.org "Whats your Learning Style?" test. I found out that I am mainly a auditory learner. I find this very interesting because
I took a similar test to this in grade 7 which is roughly 6 years ago. The results I got from that test was that I was a visual learner more than anything else.
</p>
<li> Auditory: 40%</li>
<li> Visual: 35%</li>
<li> Tactile: 25%</li>
<p>Campainer ENFP-T is what I got after completing the personality test from 16personalities.com. 
I found the test to be very accurate in that I am Extroverted (67% percent to be exact). The results continue to speak truths
about how interact with my colleagues. The article explains that I view colleagues as friends, people who I show genuine interest in 
and care for. I find this so accurate as I enjoy spending time with people at work. More details on what exactly a 
Campaigner ENFP-T can be found here: <a href= "https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality"> 16personalities.com/enfp-personality</a> </p>

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">My Ideal Job</h2>
    <hr style="width:978px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p> My ideal Job is a software engineer/developer. I have a lot of different career paths I am interested in, but all of them revolve around being a software engineer or developer.
I have a dream career in video game development, specifically creating my own engine. I would love to create a team of like minded people working towards the same goal,
creating a story and world full of exploration. I would be working with pre-built software (commonly know as "engines") using C/C++ and API's making sure that idea's and concepts
transition into the game smoothly.
